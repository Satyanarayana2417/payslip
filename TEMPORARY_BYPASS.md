# üö® TEMPORARY LOGIN BYPASS (For Testing Only)

## If You Need to Login Immediately

Follow these steps to temporarily bypass authorization and login:

### Step 1: Backup Current File
1. Make a copy of `src/pages/AdminLogin.tsx`
2. Name it `AdminLogin.tsx.backup`

### Step 2: Apply Temporary Fix

Open `src/pages/AdminLogin.tsx` and find this line (around line 171):

```typescript
const isAuthorized = await isAuthorizedAdmin(user.uid, email);
```

**Replace it with:**
```typescript
const isAuthorized = true; // ‚ö†Ô∏è TEMPORARY BYPASS - REMOVE AFTER TESTING!
console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è AUTHORIZATION CHECK BYPASSED - FOR TESTING ONLY! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è');
```

### Step 3: Save and Test Login

Your login should now work with any Firebase credentials.

### Step 4: IMPORTANT - Restore Security

After you successfully login and verify Firebase works:

1. **UNDO** the change
2. Restore the original line:
```typescript
const isAuthorized = await isAuthorizedAdmin(user.uid, email);
```
3. Save the file
4. **This is critical for security!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

**DO NOT deploy to production with this bypass enabled!**

This is **ONLY** for local testing to verify:
- Firebase authentication works
- Your email/password are correct
- The app redirects properly

Once verified, we can fix the authorization issue properly.

---

## Alternative: Add Debug Mode

Instead of bypassing, you can add a debug mode:

```typescript
// Add at top of AdminLogin component
const DEBUG_MODE = true; // Set to false for production

// Then change authorization check to:
const isAuthorized = DEBUG_MODE ? true : await isAuthorizedAdmin(user.uid, email);

if (DEBUG_MODE) {
  console.log('üîß DEBUG MODE: Authorization check bypassed');
}
```

This way you can easily toggle it on/off.

**Use this only if you're completely stuck and need to access the app urgently!**
