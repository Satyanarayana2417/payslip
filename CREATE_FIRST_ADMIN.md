## 📝 Step-by-Step: Create First Admin

### Method 1: Firebase Console (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Access Firebase Console
1. Open browser
2. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com

   Password: YourSecurePassword123!
   (minimum 6 characters)
   ```
5. Click **"Add User"**
6. ✅ User created! Copy the **User UID** (you'll need it)

#### Step 3: Add Email to Authorized List
1. Open your project folder
2. Navigate to: `src/pages/AdminLogin.tsx`

     'satyanarayana2417@gmail.com',
   ];
   ```
4. Add your email:

     'admin@dreamteamservices.com',
     'admin@payslip.com',
     'satyanarayana2417@gmail.com',
     'youremail@domain.com',  // Your new admin email
   ];
   ```
5. Save the file

#### Step 4: Create Firestore Document (Optional but Recommended)
1. In Firebase Console, go to **"Firestore Database"**
2. If prompted, click **"Create database"** (Start in test mode)
3. Click **"Start collection"**
4. Collection ID: `users`

   createdAt      timestamp   (Click "Set to current time")
   lastLogin      timestamp   (Click "Set to current time")
   ```
8. Click **"Save"**

#### Step 5: Test Login
1. Open your app: `http://localhost:8080`
2. You'll see the secure login page with warnings
3. Enter:
   - Email: `admin@dreamteamservices.com`
   - Password: (the password you set)
4. Click **"🔐 Admin Sign In"**
5. ✅ Should show: **"✅ Access Granted - Welcome back, Admin!"**
6. ✅ Redirected to main website

## 🎯 Quick Template

Use this as a template for each new admin:

```javascript
// In Firebase Authentication
Email: newadmin@company.com
Password: SecurePass123!
UID: [Copy this after creating]

// In src/pages/AdminLogin.tsx
const AUTHORIZED_ADMINS = [
  // ... existing admins ...
  'newadmin@company.com',  // Add here
];

// In Firestore Database > users collection
Document ID: [Paste UID]
Fields:
  - userId: [Paste UID]
  - email: "newadmin@company.com"
  - role: "admin"
  - username: "New Admin"
  - createdAt: [Current timestamp]
  - lastLogin: [Current timestamp]
```

## 🔒 Default Test Admins

For testing purposes, these emails are pre-authorized:

| Email | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `admin@dreamteamservices.com` | ✅ Authorized | Company admin |
| `admin@payslip.com` | ✅ Authorized | System admin |
| `satyanarayana2417@gmail.com` | ✅ Authorized | Developer account |

**You still need to create these accounts in Firebase Authentication!**

---

## ⚡ Quick CLI Method (Advanced)

If you have Firebase CLI installed:

```bash
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Set project
firebase use payslip-generator-b8317

# Create user (interactive)
firebase auth:import users.json
```

Create `users.json`:
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "email": "admin@dreamteamservices.com",
      "passwordHash": "base64-encoded-hash",
      "uid": "auto-generated-uid"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Test 1: Authorized Admin Login
```
Email: admin@dreamteamservices.com (must be in AUTHORIZED_ADMINS)
Password: [correct password]
Expected: ✅ Access Granted → Redirect to website
```

### ❌ Test 2: Unauthorized User Login
```
Email: random@email.com (NOT in AUTHORIZED_ADMINS)
Password: [correct password]
Expected: ⚠️ Access Denied → Signed out → Stay on login page
Message: "You are not authorized to access this admin portal"
```

### ❌ Test 3: Wrong Password
```
Email: admin@dreamteamservices.com
Password: [wrong password]
Expected: ⚠️ Access Denied → Stay on login page
Message: "⚠️ Incorrect password. Please try again."
```

### ❌ Test 4: Non-existent Email
```
Email: nonexistent@email.com
Password: anything
Expected: ⚠️ Access Denied → Stay on login page
Message: "⚠️ Access Denied: No authorized admin account found"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I created user but can't login"
**Check**:
1. Email is added to `AUTHORIZED_ADMINS` array
2. Email matches exactly (case-insensitive)
3. File is saved and server restarted

### "Access Granted but then signed out"
**Solution**: Your email is not in the `AUTHORIZED_ADMINS` list. Add it and restart server.

### "User UID not found"
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Users
2. Click on the user
3. Copy the UID
4. Use this UID in Firestore document

### "Firestore error"
**Solution**: Firestore document is optional. The authorization works from the `AUTHORIZED_ADMINS` array.
